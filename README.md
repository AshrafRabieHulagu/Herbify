Project Proposal
1. Project Name and Tagline
Project Name:
Herbify

Tagline:
A marketplace connecting herb exporters with global buyers through a secure, seamless, and user-friendly platform.

2. Team Members
Team:
Name: [Your Name]
Role: Full-stack Developer
Reason for Role: I will be responsible for building both the front-end and back-end of the project, leveraging my skills in React, Node.js, and MongoDB to deliver a functional and scalable product.
3. Technologies
Libraries, Languages, Platforms, and Frameworks:
Front-End:
React.js: A powerful and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
CSS/Bootstrap: For responsive and mobile-friendly design.
Back-End:
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for handling server-side logic.
Express.js: A fast and minimalistic web framework for Node.js.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for managing user profiles, product listings, and transactions.
Payments:
Stripe API: For handling secure payments and checkout.
Hosting/Deployment:
Heroku: Cloud platform to deploy and host the back-end server.
Netlify: For hosting the front-end.
Trade-offs and Alternative Technologies:
React.js vs. Angular:
React.js was chosen for its flexibility and large ecosystem of third-party libraries. Angular is a more opinionated framework with more built-in features, but it has a steeper learning curve. React's component-based architecture also fits well with the small to medium-sized project like Herbify.
MongoDB vs. MySQL:
MongoDB was selected for its flexibility with unstructured data and faster development speed. While MySQL offers stronger relational capabilities and stricter schema, MongoDB’s ability to handle large amounts of diverse data makes it better suited for Herbify’s needs, especially as the platform grows to accommodate various product listings.
4. Challenge Statement
Problem Statement:
Herb exporters and buyers often face challenges connecting on an international scale. Herbify aims to solve this by providing a secure, easy-to-use online marketplace where sellers can list their products and buyers can easily browse and purchase them.

What Herbify Will Not Solve:
Herbify will not handle logistics or shipment. It only connects buyers and sellers for transactions.
Target Audience:
Sellers: Herb exporters looking to expand their market reach internationally.
Buyers: Businesses and individuals who are in the market for herbal products, such as essential oils, dried herbs, and medicinal plants.
Locale Relevance:
The platform is not restricted to a specific location. It is designed to facilitate global trade of herbal products.

5. Risks
Technical Risks:
Payment Processing Issues:

Impact: Incorrect integration of the Stripe API may lead to transaction failures or security vulnerabilities.
Safeguards: Thorough testing and compliance with Stripe's best practices and security guidelines.
Scalability:

Impact: If the app gains traction, scaling the platform may be difficult if not architected properly from the beginning.
Safeguards: Start with a microservices-friendly architecture and scalable cloud solutions like MongoDB Atlas.
Non-Technical Risks:
User Trust:

Impact: New platforms often struggle to gain user trust, especially in sensitive areas like payments and data security.
Safeguards: Clear communication about security measures, data encryption, and secure payment processing.
Market Competition:

Impact: Existing platforms might dominate the market, making it hard for Herbify to attract users.
Safeguards: Differentiate by focusing on a niche (herbs) and offering unique features like simplified international transactions and order tracking.
6. Infrastructure
Branching and Merging Strategy:
GitHub Flow:
The team will follow the GitHub flow process, which involves feature branches for each task. Once a feature is completed, it will be merged into the main branch via pull requests and reviewed by peers.
Deployment Strategy:
The back-end will be deployed using Heroku for its ease of use and scalability. The front-end will be deployed using Netlify for its seamless integration with React.
Populating the App with Data:
Data will be populated by the sellers who create their product listings. For testing purposes, dummy data will be used during development and staging.
Testing and Automation:
Jest will be used for unit testing the React components.
Postman for testing the back-end API endpoints.
7. Existing Solutions
Existing Platforms:
Amazon:

Similarity: Amazon allows sellers to list their products and buyers to purchase from around the world.
Difference: Amazon handles a wide range of products and categories, while Herbify focuses solely on the herbal niche.
Alibaba:

Similarity: Alibaba connects suppliers with international buyers, similar to the goal of Herbify.
Difference: Herbify will specifically cater to small and medium-sized herbal exporters and have a simpler interface focused on direct transactions.
Etsy:

Similarity: Etsy also allows sellers to list handmade or specialty products, including herbs and natural products.
Difference: Herbify will focus exclusively on the herbal market and offer features tailored to this niche, such as specialized categories for medicinal and culinary herbs.
