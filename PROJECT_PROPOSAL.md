## Tagline:
Connecting herb exporters with global buyers through a secure, seamless, and user-friendly platform.

## Team Members:
- [Ashraf Hulagu] - Full-stack Developer

## Technologies:
### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js (API)
- MongoDB (Database)
  
### Frontend
- React.js (UI)
  
### Deployment
- AWS for cloud infrastructure
  
### Alternative Technologies Considered:
- **Backend Alternative:** Flask (Python), but Node.js was chosen for its asynchronous capabilities.
- **Database Alternative:** PostgreSQL, but MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility with unstructured data.

## Challenge Statement:
The Herbify project aims to provide a platform for herb exporters to connect with buyers worldwide. It will simplify the process of discovering and purchasing unique herbs from different regions.

### Not in Scope:
- Payment processing will not be implemented in the first version.

### User Demographics:
- Herb exporters and buyers from various global locations.

### Locale Specifics:
The platform will operate globally and will not be dependent on any specific locale.

## Risks:
### Technical Risks:
- **Security**: Safeguards include authentication and data encryption.
- **Scalability**: Risk of high traffic load impacting performance.

### Non-Technical Risks:
- **Market Adoption**: Slow user adoption could impact growth.

## Infrastructure:
- **Git Flow** will be used for branching and merging.
- **AWS EC2** for hosting and **S3** for file storage.
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests with **Jest** and **Mocha**.

## Existing Solutions:
- Similar platforms exist for agricultural products, but none focused specifically on herbs. Examples include Alibaba for general products and TradeIndia for herb exporters.
